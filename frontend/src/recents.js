Therefore, we tried to estimate the response and safety of inactivated vaccines for COVID-19 in LTx recipients from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, which owns the National Center for Infectious Diseases and is one of the largest transplant centers in China.',

For the finger biomechanics design, finger joint lengths, angular workspace ranges and joint torques were determined experimentally. Moreover, joint torques during finger extension/flexion movements were calculated through SolidWorks motion analysis and Ansys static structural analysis.',
